# v1.microblog.chriskrycho.com

This is the home of my [micro.blog](https://micro.blog)-hosted... microblog. It is v1 because it is the first version to live at this subdomain: somewhat confusingly, because I also had v1.notes.chriskrycho.com, but wanted to reserve the "notes" name for, well, *notes* going forward. 🤷🏻‍♂️.
