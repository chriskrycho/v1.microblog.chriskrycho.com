<ol>
<li>Connect all your devices to Zwift.</li>
<li><em>Don’t</em> actually start recording on your Garmin.</li>
<li>Sync: Zwift → Garmin Connect → watch → Garmin Connect.</li>

			 <p>It strikes me: In the amount of time I&rsquo;ve spent working around quirks in my current static site generator engine plus the amount of time I&rsquo;ve spent <em>waiting around for it</em> because of its slow design and not-great data structure choices, I&rsquo;m quite sure I could have written my own.</p>
<p>That isn’t to discredit the folks behind the tech I’m currently using (I didn’t name it apurpose!) so much as to affirm <a href="https://micro.blog/brandur">@brandur</a>&rsquo;s point <a href="https://brandur.org/aws-intrinsic-static">many years ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve found that assembling my own static site generation script takes about the same amount of time as getting on-boarded with any of the major site generation frameworks. This isn’t as much a critique of them as it is a nod to the inevitability of any general-purpose project to expand in features until it takes a lot of documentation and false starts to get up to speed. Writing your own script may be a greater maintenance burden over the long run, but this is offset by the much improved flexibility that it gets you.</p>
